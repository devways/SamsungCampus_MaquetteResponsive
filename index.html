                <p>About Us</p>
                <p>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!
Bender?! You stole the atom. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me.</p>
                <p>No! Don't jump! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? I love you, buddy! Is that a cooking show?
And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? I love you, buddy!</p>
